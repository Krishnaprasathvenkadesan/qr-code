# QR Code Attendance System

![QR Code Scanner](https://img.shields.io/badge/QR%20Code-Scanner-green) ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

This is a simple QR Code Attendance System designed to scan QR codes using a webcam and store the scanned data in a backend system. The project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it uses the [jsQR](https://github.com/cozmo/jsQR) library for QR code decoding.

## Features
- **Real-time QR Code Scanning**: Uses the device's camera to scan QR codes in real-time.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Success Feedback**: Displays a success message when a QR code is successfully scanned.
- **Backend Ready**: Includes a placeholder function to send scanned data to a backend API.
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear error messages if the camera is inaccessible or no QR code is detected.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- A device with a working webcam.
- Node.js (optional, for local development).

### Steps to Set Up Locally
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Krishnaprasathvenkadesan/qr-code.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd qr-code
   ```
3. Start a local server:
   - Using Python:
     ```bash
     python -m http.server 8000
     ```
   - Or any other lightweight HTTP server.
4. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

---

## Usage
1. Open the application in your browser.
2. Click the **"Start Scanning"** button to activate the webcam.
3. Point the camera at a QR code.
4. Once the QR code is scanned:
   - A success message will appear with the scanned data.
   - The camera will stop automatically.
5. The scanned data can be sent to a backend server for further processing (e.g., attendance registration).

---

## Backend Integration
The project includes a placeholder function `saveAttendance(data)` to send the scanned QR code data to a backend API. You can integrate it with your backend as follows:

### Example: Sending Data to a Backend
Replace the `saveAttendance` function in `script.js` with an actual API call:

```javascript
function saveAttendance(data) {
    fetch('/attendance', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({ qrCode: data }),
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(result => {
        console.log('Attendance saved:', result);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error saving attendance:', error);
    });
}
```

### Backend Setup
- Ensure your backend has an endpoint (e.g., `/attendance`) to handle POST requests.
- Parse the incoming JSON data (`qrCode`) and store it in your database.
